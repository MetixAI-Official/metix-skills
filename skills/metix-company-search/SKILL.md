# Metix AI company search

Search returns `company_ids`. Detail returns the records. Field names, operators,
and enumerations come from the live contract and the docs pages below, not from
this file.

The same pages are rendered for people at `https://platform.metix.ai/docs`.

## How to call

1. `GET /contract` (or MCP `metix_get_contract`). Build `where` only from
   `querySpecByEntity.company`. The field list is closed; a name outside it is
   refused. Use the operators `fieldOperators` lists for each field: exact
   fields such as `type` take `eq` or `in` with a value from the companies
   page, ordered fields such as `size` also take `gte`, `gt`, `lte` and `lt` by
   position in their value list, and `match` is only for free-text fields such
   as `industry`.
2. `POST /v1/companies/query`, then `POST /entity/v1/companies/detail-by-id`
   with up to 100 of those IDs. Search never returns records.
3. On a 4xx, switch on `error_code`; `msg` says what to change. For the full
   explanation, fetch `docs_url` with `.md` added to the path:
   `https://platform.metix.ai/docs/reference/errors#query-refusals` becomes
   `https://platform.metix.ai/docs/reference/errors.md`, and `query-refusals`
   names the section to read.
4. If this file and the live contract disagree, the contract wins.

## A first call

```bash
curl -s https://mira-api.metix.ai/v1/companies/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $METIX_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"where": {"all": [
        {"field": "industry", "match": "biotechnology"},
        {"field": "size", "gte": "51-200"}]},
       "size": 25}'
# data.company_ids, data.total, and data.next while more pages remain

curl -s https://mira-api.metix.ai/entity/v1/companies/detail-by-id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $METIX_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"company_ids": ["<an id from data.company_ids>"],
       "_source": ["id", "name", "industry", "size", "headquarters.country"]}'
```

For the next page, send `data.next` back as `after` with the same `where`.

## Local rules

Every call reads `METIX_KEY` from the environment. If it is unset, stop and tell
the user to set it. Do not substitute another variable, and do not search the
machine for a lookalike key.

Never print the key, write it into a file, or include it in a summary.

Do not invent a contact-email route. That capability is not callable.

Credits are charged in result bands. One ID per request is the expensive way to
walk a set; batch. The formulas live on `/docs/credits.md`.
